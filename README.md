Coursera Getting And Clearning Data Course Project

This is the course project for a course in the Data Analyst's Toolbox track.

The file run_analysis.R, merges the data and column descriptors from eight different text files and selects only the measurements of means or standard deviations.
Then, the data are sorted by subject and then activity (with the mean of each measurement from the original data set) into a tidy data set that is written to a file
called tidy_data_set.txt.
